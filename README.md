# vba_challenge_reja


**Background**

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

**Before You Begin**

1. Created a new repository for this project called **VBA-challenge**. 

2. Inside the new repository that I just created, added the solution VBA file and Xlms files that I used for this assignment.

**Instructions**


Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock. The images of the results:

- Add functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The images of the results:

  
- Made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
